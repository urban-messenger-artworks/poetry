I can still remember, out last summer days
Chatted and laughed, all afternoon long
At L'Usine the cafeteria.

Horror movies? All the times!
Ouuch we'd laughed and laughed
When they all were screaming!

I can still reccall
Eveytime we talked and could not stop talking
About the movie! The logics! The possibilities!
And after that Japanese thing...
We talked philosophy, no shit!
And about life.

And you, "la vie".
