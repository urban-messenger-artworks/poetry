We live a life to suffocate
To trade our souls for unmet faces
Of the people we'd never seen
We rise against the darkness fall

We left warm homes to journey on
Refused to love, refused to feel
To keep one heart and one strong will
We rise against the darkness fall

We saw their pains, their grief, their angers
Deep in the eyes of them-passersby
Stories unheard must now be told
We rise against the darkness fall

We dance with Death in a hurricane
Just few lone wolves against the storm
Torn out in wounds but fortified
We rise against the darkness fall

We make our stand next to the fallen friends
One last time face the darkened days
And welcome Death just like old times
We rise against the darkness fall

And the darkness falls, to a savage end.
