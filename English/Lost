On the lonely road I have chosen,
On the relentless journey of no return,
Love had long been lost in the past shadow.
Sometime ago, there was hope,
A hope of salvation, of reconciliation.
But this world, this cruel world
Wields nothing but wickedness in retaliation
For hope, for love, for inner peace.
Thee, thee of the old days I seek
In the numb apricity of a sunny day.
I murmured your name
Through the void of faceless crowds.
Sliping through my seizing fingers,
The presence of thou still lingers.
But dark was there,
Lurking in its own shadow.
Waiting to wreak terrors upon the day
I know, I know the dark is just
And the dark does not embrace.
Hope will end up in vain
Love be the fairy tale of the lost ages,
When this shadow hath yet to swallow our world.
For no longer we may reunite.
For no longer we may reconcile.
The spring is dead
Long time ago.
